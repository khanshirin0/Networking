Prerequisites:

Hardware Setup:

Server machine (RHEL 9 installed)
Client machines (Linux-based or any other OS)
Ethernet cables and network switches/hubs

Static IP Addresses:

Decide on IP address ranges for both the server and client machines. For example:

Server: 192.168.1.1
Clients: 192.168.1.2, 192.168.1.3, etc

Steps:

1. Configure Static IP Addresses on RHEL 9:

Edit the network configuration file for the server:

sudo nano /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0

Add the following lines (modify the IP address and other settings based on your network requirements):

TYPE=Ethernet
DEVICE=eth0
BOOTPROTO=static
IPADDR=192.168.1.1
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
ONBOOT=yes

Restart the network service:

sudo systemctl restart network

2. Set Up DHCP Server:

Install the DHCP package:

sudo dnf install dhcp-server
 
Edit the DHCP configuration file:
sudo nano /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf

Add the DHCP configuration (modify the IP address range and subnet mask):

subnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
  range 192.168.1.100 192.168.1.200;
  option routers 192.168.1.1;
  option domain-name-servers 192.168.1.1;
  default-lease-time 600;
  max-lease-time 7200;
}

Enable and start the DHCP service:

sudo systemctl enable dhcpd
sudo systemctl start dhcpd

3. Configure DNS:

Edit the DNS resolver configuration file:

sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf

Add DNS server addresses (for example, Google's public DNS):

nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4

4. Client Machines Configuration:

On the client machines, configure static IP addresses or set them to obtain IP addresses via DHCP depending on your needs.

5. Network Troubleshooting:

Check Connectivity: Use ping to check connectivity between machines.

ping 192.168.1.1  # Replace with the IP address of the server

Check DNS Resolution: Use nslookup to check DNS resolution.

nslookup example.com  # Replace with the domain you want to resolve

Check DHCP Lease: On the client machines, check if they received an IP address from the DHCP server.

These steps provide a basic setup for a small LAN with Linux-based servers and client machines. Adjust the configurations based on your specific network requirements and hardware setup. Remember, network troubleshooting often involves using tools like ping, traceroute, nslookup, and checking system logs (/var/log/messages and /var/log/syslog).
